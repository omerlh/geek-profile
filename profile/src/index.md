## About me
I'm coding since 4th grade, when my dad taught me BASIC and haven’t looked back since. I'm an AppSec/DevSecOps enthusiast, and always curious about integrating more hacking tools into the CI/CD pipeline. I'm always looking for new interesting ways to increase security awareness over the entire R&D - developers, product and UX. I highly believe in OWASP and a proud member. I am an open source addict, using OSS heavily and keep contributing back. 

Today I'm working at [Soluto](https://www.solutotlv.com) by day and learning for B.A. in humanities (mainly Judaism currently) by night (ETA: 2025). And  before all that, I am Father and Spouse.
